IPX kernel module for Linux 4.18+
---------------------------------

To build the ipx module, simply run `make`. For non-standard kernel sources
location: `make KERNELDIR=<kernel-sources-path>`.

Current module depends on "psnap" and "p8022" kernel modules. In case you build
the kernel manually, make sure to enable CONFIG_LLC.

You may also want to check userspace utilities:
